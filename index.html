                  The <strong>Feast of the Black Nazarene</strong> commemorates the transfer of a dark wooden statue of Jesus Christ to its home in Quiapo Church. The image was originally brought from Mexico in 1606 by Augustinian Recollect friars and was initially housed in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), then moved to an Intramuros church before its final relocation to Quiapo. The feast is celebrated with a massive procession called the <em>Traslacion</em>, which draws millions of devotees annually.

                  The "Liberation of Manila" is not a single, official, large-scale national festival, but rather a series of commemorative events and historical exhibits held annually in February to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Manila in 1945, one ofthe most brutal and tragic urban battles of World War II.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The events commemorate the month-long battle (February 3 - March 3, 1945) in which combined American and Filipino forces liberated the capital city from the Imperial Japanese Army.
                </p>
                <p>The annual commemoration holds profound cultural significance as a solemn reminder of the immense human cost of war, the resilience of the Filipino people, and the enduring value of freedom and democracy.</p>

Niño as a protector and source of miracles, making it the oldest and oen of the most beloved devotions in the Philippines.
